Product History
---------------

Created CUTE Version 2  4/09/13

1. New source repository (CCT_BIT_2) created in CVS.

2. Various system stability improvements added.

3. LWIP network stack and Ethernet driver for Intel Gigabit devices added.

4. Board specific configuration options added.

5. Enhancements for system debugging added.

6. Initial tidy up of original CUTE/BIT source files, removing build warnings.  


CUTE 2.01.01-rc01  27/9/13

1. Added new network Soak Master Client.

2. Added support for the new Universal Soak Master.

3. Removed obsolete HAL code and library.

4. Added support for the new version format.

5. Further tidy up of original CUTE/BIT source files, including adding file and
   function headers when found missing.

6. Added board service to retrieve the slot ID. Modified the Soak Master Client
   and STH to assign the board address based slot ID, when handling a slave 
   information request from the Universal Soak Master.     


CUTE 2.01.01-rc02  8/10/13

1. Updates for Cygwin 1.7.25 GCC 4.7.3-1, fixed various compiler warnings. 

2. Revised USM_BOARDADDR_SLOTID_MASK and USM_BOARDADDR_INST_MASK defines.
   Added USM_BOARDADDR_INST_SHIFT define.
   
  
CUTE 2.01.01-rc03  14/10/13

1. Added SRIO support and AM 94x/x1x board.


CUTE 2.01.01-rc04  20/01/14
   
1. Added support for VX 81x/09x board.   


CUTE 2.01.02  14/02/14

1. Added timeout to the SPS status request in tsi721_init() to prevent an infinite 
   loop during startup when the request fails.
   
2. Forced debug mode on to allow reporting of initial startup messages to aid
   test department and diagnostics.
   
3. Added extra check of Soak Master IP address in SM client and connection retry 
   if found to be zero. Added Soak Master IP address and connection retry count
   to SM client statistics.
   
4. Fixed Ethernet test function used to find the given instance of a 825xx device. 
   If the found instance was indicated to be skipped, it was previously also 
   skipping the remaining device instances of a multifunction device. 
   
5. Fixed reporting of Ethernet MAC addresses, on AM 94x/x1x board, for devices 
   not connected to the network stack.
   
6. Added debug log commands to telnet client.   
   
7. Modified IPMI sensor threshold test to report failure only for Upper Critical
   and Upper Non Recoverable conditions. 
   
8. Added build option for AM 945 variant to workaround IPMI firmware bug that 
   reports negative temperatures as high positive values on sensor 2. When this 
   build option is selected, sensor 2 is compared with sensor 1 and a test failure 
   is not indicated if sensor 2 is reported by the IPMI firmware as a higher value.
